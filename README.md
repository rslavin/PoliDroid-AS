# PoliDroid-AS
Android Studio plugin for the detection of potential privacy policy misalignments. PoliDroid-AS works by scanning your code in real time and detecting policy violations based on a mapping between Android API methods and a mobile privacy lexicon. Weak and soft violations are identified based on an OWL mobile privacy ontology.
